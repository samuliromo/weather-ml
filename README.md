Predict weather using neural networks

This is a very simple data preprocessing and machine learning pipeline designed as to test the differences between convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The models themselves are not very well optimized or suited for any kind of serious analysis, this was first and foremost meant to be a simple learning experience.

The dataset used for the models was weather data from a 4 year period in 1 minute intervals. You can download it here: https://www.kaggle.com/ktochylin/san-diego-every-minute-weather-indicators-201114 Extract the csv file into the same directory as <code>pipeline.py</code>

To run the models, use <code>Python 3.7.2</code> or higher. Install the dependencies with <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>.
